I am currently a doctoral researcher at [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences](https://www.mis.mpg.de) and [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology](https://www.evolbio.mpg.de/2169/en). My advisors are [Jürgen Jost](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hoY8se8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Arne Traulsen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=jlfYejEAAAAJ).

My research focuses on analysing complex phenomena using mathematical tools, including 
dynamical systems, agent-based modelling and evolutionary game theory. In particular, I employ tools from nonlinear dynamics, as well as stochastic simulations, to study decision-making at an individual and collective level.  My research also  includes interdisciplinary collaboration, most notably with experimental economists.
